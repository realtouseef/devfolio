# DevFolio ⚡️

## For Developers, By a Developer

A minimal and easy-to-tweak portfolio for developers made with [TailwindCSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). The best thing is, someone with a basic know-how of TailwindCSS and NextJS will be able to tweak it according to their needs.

## Make it yours

Just change `src/portfolio.js` to get your personal portfolio. Customize portfolio theme by using your own color scheme globally in the `n/a` file. Feel free to use it as-is or personalize it as much as you want.

## For Contribution

If you'd like to **contribute** and make this much better for other users, kindly fork it and feel free to open a [pull request](https://github.com/realtouseef/devfolio/pulls).
