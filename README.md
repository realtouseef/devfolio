# DevFolio ⚡️

## For Developers, By a Developer

A minimal and easy-to-tweak portfolio for developers made with [TailwindCSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). The best thing is, someone with a basic know-how of TailwindCSS and NextJS will be able to tweak it according to their needs.
